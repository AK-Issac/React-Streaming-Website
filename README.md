React Streaming Website

This is an anime streaming website fully coded in React, using an API and integrating features such as authentication, history, and episode viewing.

The development of this project was divided into 3 separate parts, as outlined in the .docx files (unfortunately, they are in French).
To run this project:

    Open a code editor such as WebStorm or Visual Studio Code.

    Open a terminal in the project directory.

    Enter the following commands:

    npm install
    npm run dev

Then, open a popular web browser and type the following address:

    localhost:5173

This will redirect you to the main page of my project, where you can test the functionalities.
